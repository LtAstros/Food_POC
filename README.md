## Food üçΩÔ∏è
This dataset has food recipes information from [food.com](food.com). It was originally scrapped and used by the authors to [this](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf) recommender system paper.

### Getting the Data

### Cleaning and EDA
{:.no_toc}

Follow all of the steps in the [Requirement: Cleaning and EDA](#requirement-cleaning-and-eda-exploratory-data-analysis) section. Note:
- As stated in the data dictionary, the nutrition column stored data as lists in this order: `[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV) , sodium (PDV) , protein (PDV) , saturated fat (PDV) , and carbohydrates (PDV)]`. If you want to to use this data for your analysis, you may want to turn these lists into new columns for each of the values.
- You might also want to explore the dtypes for each column and change them into easier-to-handle dtypes if possible. (i.e. convert the data that looks like lists to actual lists or converting the dates into `datetime`)
